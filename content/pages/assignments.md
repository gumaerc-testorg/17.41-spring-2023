### Short Policy Memos

Three memos of up to 1000 words each (excluding references), responding to a prompt and recommending a course of action to a policymaker based on principles from class. These assignments are designed to get you to apply the concepts you are learning in class to real world issues. Memos that regurgitate current events and do not apply key concepts from class will do poorly. Memos that creatively apply concepts from class to propose innovative policies will do well.

### Long Policy Memo

A memo of up to 4000 words (excluding references) on an international relations policy problem of your choice.  You should explain the problem, offer at least two possible courses of action based on principles from the class, and then defend one as the best course of action. This final memo will have a graded first draft, and a graded final draft.
