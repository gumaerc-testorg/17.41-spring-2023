Short policy memos on timely topics are a crucial part of government and private sector operations.<sup>1</sup> 17.41 has three short memo assignments during the semester.

We will give a prompt for each of these short memos. The prompt will pose the policy problem to which you should respond, and the policymaker to whom you should imagine you are writing. You should respond to the prompt and recommend a course of action to a policymaker based on principles from class.

Instructors and TAs will not read drafts of short policy memos, but we will discuss it if you ask us.

Each memo is worth 5% of your grade.

*Format*

Memos should be no longer than 1,000 words 

(**not** including bibliographical references). At the top of your memo, please write the total number of words. We will penalize memos over 1,000 words. This means you need to be extremely succinct and not waste space on “throat clearing” or on regurgitating background information that is irrelevant to your proposal. One common format for the memo is **Summary, Background, Analysis, and Recommendation**.

- The *summary* goes first—it should be a one-paragraph summary of the policy problem, your analysis, and your recommendation.
- The *background* should consist of a concise\* review of the policy problem at hand, any relevant policy responses in recent years, and why the issue affects the interests of your audience. 
    - \*“Concise” means not discussing decades of history—just hit the high notes and get to the current state of play.
- The *analysis* should discuss the range, sequencing, and likely outcome of possible policy options. By “possible” we mean those options that could be pursued without sucking up so many resources that your country’s foreign policy elsewhere could not be executed.
    - Give your opinions for why a particular option is good or bad, and give the reasoning behind your opinion. Simply asserting “bombing will not work” is not good enough. Why? Why not?
    - You might consider whether the option will receive allied and multilateral support, or domestic political support. But be clear on why this would or would not matter.
    - You need to present at least two clearly defined policy options.
- The *recommendation* should sum up your analysis. Remember, you are being asked to choose the best option from a constrained menu.
- You can recommend combinations and sequences of different policy tools, but remember you have very limited space.
- Clearly state why you have selected the policy option you have.

*Expectations and Advice*

These assignments are designed to get you to apply the concepts you are learning in class to real world issues. Memos that regurgitate current events and do not apply key concepts from class will do poorly. Memos that creatively apply concepts from class to propose innovative policies will do well. 

You may have to do original research to flesh out the background, current state of play, and the likelihood of different policy options working. This could include:  (1) Monitoring press outlets (2); Looking at official policy statements to understand stated objectives; or (3) Consulting think tank reports, policy articles, and scholarly studies of the salient countries.

Innovative incorporation of readings from class, including potentially recommended readings, is essential to the policy memo. The core idea is to apply theories we are learning in class to a real world topic.

Avoid overly vague policy prescriptions.

Substantiate all claims that are not strictly factual with evidence.

Explain how you think the intermediate objectives you advocate should be realized.

Anticipate counterarguments to your suggested policies. All possible policies are likely to have drawbacks. Demonstrate that you understand what these downsides are and argue why your proposal is still preferable to the alternatives.

Creatively apply concepts from the readings and lecture.

We encourage clear, active prose. Avoid jargon and passive voice where possible.
