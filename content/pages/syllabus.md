### Course Description

This course is an introduction to the politics of international relations. The primary purpose is to understand the causes of conflict and cooperation in the international system. We will first engage prevailing theories of international relations and then apply these theories to understand both historical and current events. To do this, we will engage classic and contemporary readings in international relations theory and then apply them to contemporary events in the news. Applications include war initiation, interstate economic relations, economic growth, crisis bargaining, international terrorism, nuclear strategy, international law, human rights, and environmental politics. 

### Readings

*Required Textbook*

Jeffrey Frieden, David Lake and Kenneth Schultz, *World Politics: Interests, Interactions, and Institutions*. 5<sup>th</sup> ed. Norton, 2021. ISBN: 9780393872231.

### News

We will sometimes begin class by pulling up an online news source and discussing how concepts from class might help us understand ongoing world events. You will be more prepared for these discussions if you keep track of the news yourself, using, for example, {{% resource_link "c9e86211-1e5f-4e04-a8e9-4c1b32719a6b" "*The New York Times*" %}} and {{% resource_link "57b902dc-c4d3-40c8-947e-3021497c4046" "Fox News" %}}.
